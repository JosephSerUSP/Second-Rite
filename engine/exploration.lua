-- {condition, commands/scriptId, sprite, trigger, name, ...} overrides.
-- `commands` owns a custom command list; `scriptId` links a common-event
-- template whose commands and presentation defaults are inherited. The
-- obsolete `script` field is not supported. The
-- LAST page whose condition passes wins (so authors order pages
-- least-to-most specific, same convention as RPG Maker), overriding
-- whichever fields it defines onto a copy of the base event; an
-- unconditioned page always matches, so it's the natural final fallback.
-- An event with no pages resolves to itself unchanged. condition accepts
-- the same flag:/hasItem:/questStatus: grammar as CONDITIONAL_BRANCH,
-- falling back to a formula (mirrors engine/director.lua's ROUTER).

--
-- A fixture with `blocksMovement` is SOLID -- a barrel stack is two metres of

-- behind it, and the predicates that place fixtures know nothing about
-- topology. So solidity is decided HERE, against one invariant:
--

-- stranded alcove loses a few, and a harmless barrel against a room wall loses
-- exactly one. Placements are validated incrementally in authored order, so
-- fixtures that are each individually safe but jointly a cut are caught too --
