"""Owner scores for staged variants, and the joins that make them useful.

The seam metric and the chroma check can both pass on a picture nobody wants.
They measure whether a texture tiles and whether it decoded sanely; neither has
an opinion about whether it looks like the game. This module is where that
opinion is kept, so a checkpoint or a LoRA can be chosen on taste and tiling
together instead of tiling alone.

The store is one flat JSON file of {key: judgement} rather than a row per run
directory. Staging directories are disposable and get swept; a judgement about
"the mature/resevil vault at depth 0.60" should outlive the render it was made
on, and a single file is also the thing an interrupted rating session can be
resumed from without reconciliation.
