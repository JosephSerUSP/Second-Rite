-- Promotion preserves history (creature-parameters.md).

-- "Promotion never recalculates statistics. It preserves all accumulated
-- lower-form growth, grants a fixed authored one-time bonus, replaces only
-- future unused growth budgets, and changes form-defined MPD, capacities,
-- affinities, skills and passives."
--
-- The first clause is the one with teeth, and it is the reason growth had to
-- become accumulated first: under a smooth species curve there was no past to
-- preserve, because changing species re-derived every level retroactively.
