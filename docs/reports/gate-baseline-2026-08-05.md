# Gate Baseline Snapshot — 05.08.2026

> **This is a point-in-time measurement, not current state. Superseded.**
> Re-checked 09.08.2026; do not read any figure below as live. What has moved:
>
> - **G5 and G6 are green.** Both reds recorded here were stale golden
>   references, not regressions. Resolved by the owner-signed recapture in
>   `bd3db0b` (08.08.2026), with the G6 `database/quests.png` frame separately
>   fixed in `cd7e1a0` — that one was a real editor bug (a bare portrait key
>   resolving to a 404) masquerading as capture flakiness.
> - **The environment line below says LÖVE 11.4. Do not use it.** The local
>   binary reports `LOVE 11.5 (Mysterious Mysteries)` and CI installs 11.5;
>   `.github/workflows/verify.yml` already carries a comment working around this
>   line rather than trusting it.
> - **Frame and scene counts have moved.** G5 was 140 frames here and is 143
>   committed references plus a separate wide-surface set; G3 covered 19 scenes
>   and the engine now reports 20.
> - **`capture-editor.py` in Recommended Owner Actions never existed** in any
>   branch — the capture scripts are `capture-editor.ps1` / `.sh`. That line was
>   wrong when written, not merely stale.
>
> For the live gate roster and what each gate guards, read `docs/SPEC.md` §3;
> for what exists in the engine, `docs/ENGINE-STATE.md` (generated, G4-gated).
> Everything below is preserved unedited as the record of that day's run.

## Detailed Failure Evidence

### 1. G5 Game Screenshots (`check-screens.ps1`)
* **Status:** Failed (Exit code 1).
* **Matches:** 57 / 140 frames.
* **Mismatches:** 83 frames across `battle/`, `map/`, and `menu/` (`1`, `controls`, `datalog`, `developer_3d`, `developer_menu`, `dialogue`, `items`, `options`, `quest_log`, `reserve`, `ritual`, `save_menu`, `shop`, `status`).
* **Stability:** Stable across consecutive runs.
* **Nature of Difference:** Visual differences reflect GPU/renderer driver pipeline precision shifts alongside upstream presentation updates.

### 2. G6 Editor Screenshots (`check-editor.ps1`)
* **Status:** Failed (Exit code 1).
* **Matches:** 24 / 37 frames.
* **Mismatches (13 frames):**
  - `campaign-gen/default.png`
  - `database/actors.png` (reflects recent actor portrait additions/updates on main)
  - `database/items.png`
  - `database/quests.png`
  - `icon-picker/default.png`
  - `map-editor/command-selector.png`
  - `map-editor/event-modal.png`
  - `map-editor/map-properties.png`
  - `map-editor/mode-event.png`
  - `map-editor/mode-light.png`
  - `map-editor/mode-map.png`
  - `map-editor/mode-override.png`
  - `studio/preferences.png`
* **Stability:** Stable 13-mismatch set at current HEAD.

## Non-Reproducible Historical Failures

- **G1 failure rumors:** None. G1 passes cleanly.
- **G2 / G3 regressions:** None. Battle logs and UI event traces are byte-identical to golden references.
- **Unit test failures:** None. Unit tests pass (including `test_reachability`).
- **Savetest failure:** None. Save/load round-trip is 100% clean.

---

## Currently Reproducible Failures Ordered by Severity

1. **G5 Reference Mismatch (High Visual Scope, 83 frames):** Game scene rendering differs at pixel level from recorded golden images in `tools/golden/screens/`. Requires owner inspection of `tools/golden/screens-actual/` to approve reference update.
2. **G6 Reference Mismatch (13 editor modal/tab frames):** Headless Chrome rendering of vanilla JS editor differs from `tools/golden/editor-screens/`. Requires owner inspection of `tools/golden/editor-screens-actual/`.

## Recommended Owner Actions

- Inspect diffs in `tools/golden/screens-actual/` against `tools/golden/screens/`. If visual changes are due to GPU environment differences or accepted UI layout updates, run `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\golden\capture-screens.ps1` to update golden assets.
- Inspect `tools/golden/editor-screens-actual/` against `tools/golden/editor-screens/`. If approved, update golden editor references via `tools/golden/capture-editor.py`.
