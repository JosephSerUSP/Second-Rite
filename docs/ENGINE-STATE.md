# Engine State (generated -- do not edit)

Produced by `lovec . engine-state` (`engine/engine_state.lua`) and gated
by G4 (`tools/golden/check-state.ps1`), which regenerates this file and
fails on any diff. This is the authority on **what exists**; `docs/SPEC.md`
is the authority on **why and how**. Hand edits will be overwritten and
will fail G4.

Project data root: `data`

## Scenes

Every scene must declare a draw mode (SPEC Sec.1.2); G1 enforces it.

## Registry (authored resource: engine)

- commands: **92**
- effect types: **17**
- trait codes: **42**
- meta keys: **8** (tier, disciplines, intensityGrade, craftable, craftIngredient, dungeonOnly, detect, detectLevel)

### Registry entries with no implementation

A registry id counts as implemented when Lua source references it OR a
behavior-bearing authored resource consumes it. The two lists below are
what's left:

- **assigned** -- content (a passive, item, unit...) references it, but
  nothing consumes it. **These lie to the player**: the passive shows up
  in-game and does nothing. `ON_PERMADEATH` sat in this bucket for months.
- **unused** -- declared in the registry and never referenced anywhere.
  Harmless, but dead weight the editor still offers as a choice.

- trait codes (assigned): none
- trait codes (unused): none
- effect types (assigned): none
- effect types (unused): none
- commands (assigned): none

## Flow phases (authored resource: flows)

- `_test`: `scene`, `script_escape`
- `battle`: `after_action`, `battle_start`, `defeat`, `encounter_check`, `escaped`, `flee_attempt`, `round_end`, `round_start`, `victory`
- `exploration`: `expedition_start`, `step`
- `progression`: `level_gain_resolved`, `level_reached`
- `quest`: `complete`, `offer`

## Content inventory

- units: **65** (6 summonable-from-start, 24 with promotion paths)
- item-creation disciplines across the roster: alchemyx15, blacksmithingx15, cookingx18, tinkeringx17
- items: **207** (consumablex66, equipmentx124, questx17)
- skills: **47**, passives: **41**, states: **14**, roles: **13**, elements: **5**
- maps: **13**, common events: **20**, shops: **8**, quests: **5**, lore entries: **3**
- animations: **29**, tilesets: **14**

## Notes for agents

- This file is generated. To change it, change the engine or the data.
- `docs/SPEC.md` is the living spec; `docs/archive/**` is frozen history
  and never authoritative.
- Design docs under `docs/design/` and `docs/game design/` describe
  intent. Where they state implementation status, trust THIS file.
