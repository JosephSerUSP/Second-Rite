"""Emit render jobs for the corrected v2 fixtures.

Generated from the batch manifest rather than hand-written, so a job can never
name a height map, an operation or a recommended scale that disagrees with the
map that was actually authored -- and so `conditioningHeight` is always the twin
of `height` from the same build.
