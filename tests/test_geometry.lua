-- in viewport_3d), so a flipped tile stands beside an unflipped one constantly.
-- flipX(h)(u,v) == h(1-u,v), so the flipped tile's near seam samples exactly
-- the points the unflipped tile's far seam does: the two profiles are the same
-- set of points BEFORE decimation, and the surfaces can only meet if they are
-- still the same set afterwards.
--
-- Nothing in the decimator guarantees that. Quadrics accumulate from every
-- incident face including interior ones, and `orient` breaks ties on vertex
-- INDEX -- neither of which is invariant under mirroring.
