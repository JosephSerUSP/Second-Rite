# Image-authored geometry

**Intent, not status.** What exists right now is in `docs/ENGINE-STATE.md`; how
the shipped parts work is in `docs/SPEC.md`. This document records the design
decisions behind the image-authored geometry language and the reasoning that
produced them.

Source: *Second Rite — Image-Authored Geometry & Dungeon Surface Pipeline*
(foundation design document, 01.08.2026).

## The goal

A small, image-authored geometry language for dungeon architecture and selected
fixtures: easy to paint, deterministic to compile, and visually distinctive.
The goal is **not** universal image-to-3D reconstruction. It is a constrained
family of representations whose limitations are legible and productive.

Every generated asset is authored from exactly two textures -- one RGBA albedo
PNG and one RGBA height PNG -- plus metadata that determines how those pixels
are interpreted.

The creative advantage is immediate legibility: an artist paints a surface,
silhouette or radial field and can understand what the compiler will build.
Geometry generation becomes a deterministic craft process rather than a
black-box inference task.

## Why the compiler lives in the engine

The design document leaves open "whether wall compositions should be
precompiled during a content build or generated lazily and cached at runtime".
This project answers: **in the engine, at load, cached**.

The runtime/compiler remains the authority for this geometry language. Studio
must consume its derived geometry representation directly when it needs that
semantic result, while final-fidelity rendering and validation still use the
real runtime. A separate Python compiler would create a second authority, or
force one host to reconstruct the runtime's representation; that is the
failure `AGENTS.md` names directly. Compiling in-engine also lets G1 check
masks, dimensions and registration as ordinary validation failures rather than
as a script someone remembers to run. This geometry-specific choice does not
make LÖVE invocation mandatory for every authoring-clock interaction.

The cost is real and should be measured rather than assumed: there is no
cross-run cache, so every launch recompiles. Two things keep that small --
meshing samples the height field only at grid points (a 16x16 wall is 289
samples, not 16,384 pixels), and identical compositions are built once and
reused.

Image tools that *produce* the two PNGs stay in `tools/asset-gen/`. That is
pre-press authoring, not compilation, and is on the right side of the line.

## Non-goals

- Reconstructing arbitrary objects from photographs.
- Replacing OBJ for characters, furniture, branching forms or deeply undercut
  geometry. OBJ is an **equal path**, not a legacy exception.
- A universal voxel, neural or multi-view reconstruction pipeline.
- Making visual relief alter navigation collision.
- Growing the tileset for its own sake. The art direction prefers a small
  number of excellent surfaces over many weak variants.

## Design principles

- **Two-texture discipline.** No generated asset needs more than an albedo PNG
  and a height PNG. Additional meaning comes from metadata.
- **Constraints as style.** Each topology makes a useful promise about what it
  can represent. Assets outside that promise use OBJ rather than forcing the
  format to become universal.
- **Compiler-owned topology.** Pixels describe fields and masks. Code owns
  triangulation, seams, winding, UVs, normals and caching.
- **Renderer simplicity.** The runtime receives an ordinary mesh and needs no
  topology-specific path.
- **Visible failure.** Unsupported masks, mismatched silhouettes and impossible
  geometry produce diagnostics, never silent repair.
- **Art before abstraction.** Validated through a finished showcase room;
  tooling evolves in response to real authoring friction.

## The asset contract

A geometry asset is a directory holding `albedo.png`, `height.png` and
`asset.json`. The metadata is descriptive -- it declares topology, geometric
scale, composition behaviour, mesh density and edge behaviour -- and is never a
third visual map.

| Channel | Albedo | Height |
|---|---|---|
| RGB | Visible surface colour | A grayscale geometric value; the topology decides whether it is signed displacement, outward depth, or radial offset |
| A | Visual opacity, and colour compositing for surface fixtures | Geometric influence for surface layers, or geometric coverage for generated objects |

Opacity stays in the albedo so stained or translucent materials can remain
visually transparent while still possessing geometry.

### Tileset-level height maps

Ordinary atlas materials may declare an optional `heightMap` on the tileset
instead of becoming one geometry directory per tile. The map may be either the
same dimensions as the complete albedo atlas, or one `tileWidth` x
`tileHeight` field that is reused for every atlas cell. The renderer crops the
relevant field at load time, keeps the atlas albedo as the mesh texture, and
compiles the displaced plane through the same plane topology as a directory
asset. `heightMapScale` may be a number or a `{wall, floor, ceiling}` object.

This is the normal path for broad atlas materials and hand-authored tile
guides. Directory-backed geometry remains appropriate for exceptional
fixtures, composed shrine recesses, shells, radials, and any surface whose
albedo does not live in the tileset atlas.

### Height conventions by topology

| Topology | Grayscale | Alpha |
|---|---|---|
| Plane | Signed displacement about a neutral plane: 128 is neutral, darker recedes, lighter projects | Base surfaces are normally opaque; overlay alpha controls geometric influence |
| Shell | Unsigned distance outward from a central plane: 0 is the central plane, 255 is maximum depth | Coverage mask defining the shared front/back silhouette |
| Radial | Signed or unsigned radius variation about a declared base radius | Coverage of the radial surface at angle and height |

Begin with 8-bit height data and convert to floating point internally. The
low-poly result rarely shows 255 meaningful depth levels. Optional 16-bit
support can arrive later without changing the contract.

## The three topologies

**Plane** displaces a rectangular surface: `P(u,v) = P0 + uT + vB + h(u,v)N`.
It is the basis for walls, floors, ceilings, doors, embedded fixtures and
shallow architectural objects.

**Shell** builds one or two displaced surfaces sharing a parameterization, then
closes or pinches their common boundary. Both depth fields store nonnegative
distance from a shared central plane, so front and back cannot cross by
construction and each is easier to paint than a signed coordinate field. Modes:
`frontOnly`, `mirrorDepth`, `frontBack`. Edges either `stitch` (explicit side
faces -- slabs, idols, chests) or `pinch` (both depths converge near the
silhouette -- leaves, blades, masks).

**The depth field must reach zero at the contour** for a rounded form. This is
the single least obvious thing about authoring a shell. Depth is distance from
the central plane, so wherever it stays above zero the front and back never
meet: the object gets a flat vertical rim and reads as a slab, and a circular
silhouette sweeps a cylinder rather than a sphere. A profile with a floor in it
-- `0.35 + 0.65 * f` -- produces exactly that. For a round form use the
elliptical profile: at distance `d` from the centre of the shape,
half-thickness is `sqrt(1 - d^2)`.

A deliberate rim is a legitimate choice for slabs, tablets and seals; it should
just be a decision rather than a leftover.

In `frontBack` mode the height-alpha masks must match. Equal masks do not
themselves create the side surface; they guarantee that the same outer contour
and holes exist on both sides, and the compiler -- not the artist -- guarantees
the watertight stitch. The side strip is generated into the compiled albedo by
sampling front and rear boundary colours, defaulting to `darkenedBlend` because
it reinforces volume and separates the painted faces.

Image-plane bilateral symmetry and front/back reflection are **separate
operations with separate names**, so an asset may be authored from a half, a
face or a quarter while keeping the option to paint asymmetry.

**Radial** converts a cylindrical unwrap: horizontal is angle, vertical is
height, grayscale is distance from the axis. Suitable when each angle and
height has at most one outer radius; not for branching props or deep undercuts.

## Surfaces are composed before they are meshed

A wall fixture conceptually part of its wall should not be an unrelated mesh
floating over it. Base albedo, fixture albedo, base height and fixture height
compose first; the final pair is then meshed as one coherent surface.

Initial height operations, deliberately only three:

| Operation | Behaviour | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `none` | Composite albedo only | Paint, stains, writing |
| `add` | `base + signedOverlay * alpha` | Cracks, inscriptions, erosion, mortar |
| `replace` | `mix(base, overlay, alpha)` | Doors, inset panels, deliberate recesses |

No node graph, no field algebra. Min, max and bevel arrive only when a real
asset cannot be expressed without them.

**Registration is a hard invariant.** Any transform applied to a surface
fixture -- crop, position, scale, rotation, mirroring, atlas selection, edge
treatment -- must affect albedo and height identically.

## Texture resolution is independent of mesh resolution

A 128x128 height image must not imply 16,384 vertices. Each asset declares a
sampling grid appropriate to its visual role.

| Asset | Initial density |
|---|---|
| Wall | 12x12 to 16x16 |
| Floor | 8x8 to 12x12 |
| Ceiling | 8x8 |
| Shell object | ~16x16 to 20x20 per face |
| Radial object | 8-12 angular, 12-16 vertical |

Fixed grids first: predictable, debuggable and aesthetically appropriate.
Adaptive subdivision is an upgrade path, not a prerequisite.

Retro treatment applies *after* meaningful geometry exists. Quantization,
vertex snapping, affine texturing, fog and dithering are presentation controls;
source height data stays continuous rather than pre-posterized.

## Collision stays logical

Wall, floor and ceiling displacement is visual. Grid collision remains
authoritative. Generated object fixtures receive explicit collision metadata --
blocking or not -- rather than deriving gameplay collision from triangles. A
heightfield must never imply traversal the map cannot support.

## Diagnostics

The most important diagnostic is the **final composed albedo beside the final
composed heightfield**: it immediately localizes a problem to source art,
registration, composition, meshing or rendering. Beyond that: height alpha,
wireframe, exaggerated displacement, normals, and bounds against logical
interaction space.

## Deferred

Adaptive subdivision; marching-squares boundaries; multiple disconnected shell
islands; min/max and richer field algebra; vector displacement; layered radial
or layered depth surfaces; multi-view fusion; voxel or SDF compilers; generated
animated character topology.

Each is compatible with the architecture and none should be built before the
showcase room demonstrates a concrete need.

## Definition of done for the foundation

One room mixing composed planar architecture, an independently authored
front/back shell, a mirrored shell, a radial pillar and an OBJ prop; every
generated asset updating reliably from two PNGs plus metadata; invalid masks
failing visibly; and repeated compositions cached.

## Open decisions

- Grid-aligned silhouettes or marching-squares contours.
- Whether 16-bit height PNGs offer a real authoring advantage.
- Whether generated side albedo belongs in a compiled atlas or a dedicated
  material path.
- Whether multiple shell islands are common enough to support directly.
- Whether the next topology is extruded silhouette, richer radial components,
  or simply expanded OBJ tooling.
