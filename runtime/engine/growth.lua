-- Seeded, budget-first creature growth (projects/hichaukitoden-game/docs/archive/legacy-repo-design/creature-parameters.md).
--
-- Growth is ADDITIVE, PERMANENT, SEEDED PER INSTANCE and intentionally uneven.
-- It is not recalculated from species and current level, which is what the
-- engine used to do: `base * (1 + rate * multiplier * (level-1)^exponent)`, a
-- smooth curve every creature of a species shared exactly. Two Pixies at level
-- 12 were the same Pixie, and there was nothing for a promotion to preserve --
-- change the species and every past level silently re-derived.
--
-- Each form authors budgets for three bands (levels 2-10, 11-20, 21-30). An
-- instance's seed divides each budget into uneven packets, so a creature has a
-- HISTORY: a Pixie with a +60 HP budget for levels 21-30 might receive
-- +3, +4, +2, +3, +16, +4, +3, +17, +4, +4 -- every level raises HP, but two
-- are memorable spurts.
--
-- Determinism matters twice over. A creature generated directly at level 20
-- replays the same history it would have lived through, and reloading a save
-- can never reroll a level-up. So this uses its own LCG rather than
-- math.random: touching the global stream would both make growth depend on
-- when it happened to be computed and shift every battle roll after it.
