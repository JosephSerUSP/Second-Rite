"""Render jobs for the fractured base-surface variants.

Base surfaces need no conditioning twin: the authored map is already opaque, so
what the engine receives and what the model is conditioned on are the same image.
That is the second reason a fracture belongs here rather than in a fixture -- the
whole alpha/transparency problem simply does not arise.

Depth weight sits in the 0.56-0.62 band every 5-and-6 rated surface map used,
NOT the 0.74-0.82 the fixtures needed. A base surface fills the depth field, so
it does not have to shout over anything.
