"""Corrected fixture geometry for the 2026-08-07 owner review.

The rated 08-06 and follow-up roots stay untouched as evidence. This root fixes
the three alpha defects the owner identified (see lib/fixture_alpha.py for why
each one mattered) and, for the first time, also writes a CONDITIONING map per
fixture: the fixture merged over the base surface it will actually sit in, which
is what Stable Diffusion is shown instead of a shape floating on transparency.

Each fixture therefore emits two files:

  height/<name>.png         authoritative -- signed relief + alpha the ENGINE uses
  conditioning/<name>.png   opaque merged relief the MODEL is conditioned on

Nothing downstream may confuse the two. The engine must never receive the
conditioning map (it has no alpha, so it would claim every texel), and the model
must never be conditioned on the authoritative map (transparency is what caused
the regularization in the first place).
