"""Run a deterministic, non-agentic local wall-material comparison sweep.

This is intentionally boring: each experiment expands to a fixed grid of jobs,
leaves every run in the normal staging directory, then writes a self-contained
HTML matrix for the owner to rate.  It does not select, promote, overwrite, or
download anything.

`--experiment` picks which question is being asked.  They are listed here in
the order they were run, because each one spends the previous one's answer:

    checkpoint    which of the installed checkpoints can do masonry at all
    style-depth   which visual prior helps, and how much ControlNet weight
    surface-kit   does a wall-tuned config survive a vault, a niche, a floor
    negprompt     did the face/margin negative terms actually work (measured)
    newmodels     do purpose-trained texture models beat repurposed ones
    lora-family   which LoRA arm wins per wall subject, stacks included
    stack-partner which style LoRA best partners a texture LoRA, low ranks
                  included -- a solo score cannot predict this

The XL checkpoints are deliberately not included.  This Forge installation is
the project's 4 GB SD1.5 profile; sending SDXL checkpoints through the SD1.5
ControlNet/material path would turn this into a compatibility test rather than
a useful comparison.

# perfectly unlit albedo arrives in game with no depth in its joints and reads
# as plastic. The owner was scoring such textures down for obeying the prompt.
#
# "ao" asks for the occlusion to be painted in while still refusing DIRECT
# light, which is the part the engine really does own -- torches, direct
# shadows and their direction have to stay the renderer's job or the texture
# fights the lighting it is lit by.

# A sixth experiment, and the one the 08.08 checkpoint sweep argues for.
#
# That sweep rated 480 bare-checkpoint tiles and the best model mean was 3.50/6
# -- BELOW all three texture LoRAs measured on 03.08 (Quake 3.86, SXZ Wow 3.71,
# DiffuseTexture 3.47). Which checkpoint is loaded matters less than whether a
# texture LoRA is loaded at all, so sweeping checkpoints bare is finished.
# The factor under test here is the LORA ARM, crossed with the four wall prompt
# families, because a LoRA that carries plain masonry may well wreck ornament.
#
# Two settings are HELD, not tested: depth weight 0.85 (03.08 measured it above
# 0.60) and the "ao" material tail (the engine lights but never occludes, so a
# perfectly unlit albedo reads as plastic in game). Both are prior conclusions,
# not free parameters. Note that 08.08 ran flat/0.60, so part of its low ceiling
# may be those two settings rather than the absent LoRA -- which is exactly why
# the `control` arm is carried here under the NEW settings.
# Each arm is a LoRA STACK -- a list of (name, weight) that may be empty, hold
# one entry, or hold two. The last two arms are the interesting ones: a texture
# LoRA knows what tileable stone looks like up close but nothing about a game's
# rendering aesthetic, and a retro/screenshot LoRA is the exact opposite. The
# hypothesis is that they compose.
#
# Stacked weights are NOT both full. Two LoRAs at 0.7 apiece routinely overcook
# an SD1.5 UNet, so the texture LoRA keeps the lead weight and the style LoRA
# rides at half -- it is there to tint the rendering, not to redraw the stone.
# If a stack wins, its weight split is the next thing worth sweeping.
#
# Quake is the stack base because it holds the best all-time mean; Genesis and
# resevil are the style partners because 03.08 already settled those two as the
# only non-texture LoRAs that help. Both also appear ALONE above/below, which is
# what makes a stacked win attributable: beating `quake` and `genesis`
# separately is the only evidence that the composition did anything.
