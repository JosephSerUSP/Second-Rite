"""Parametric kit-piece generator: OBJ + MTL for the polygonal world renderer.

WHY A SCRIPT AND NOT A MESH GENERATOR (TRELLIS, Hunyuan3D, Rodin, ...):
the binding constraints for architectural kit pieces are things a generator
guarantees by construction and a neural mesh generator cannot.

  * Pieces must meet cleanly at cell boundaries (roadmap 5.4, "kit tiling
    rules"). Generated geometry is snapped to the cell by construction.
  * UVs must land on the EXISTING 64px atlas cells so a model and the wall
    behind it share texels. Neural output arrives with its own unwrap and its
    own baked texture, which is precisely the mismatch roadmap 5.4 warns about.
  * The budget is tens of triangles, faceted, at a 256x144 framebuffer. Neural
    output is dense and smooth and needs retopo before it is usable.
  * Deterministic, diffable, regenerable.

TEXEL DENSITY, the standard roadmap 5.4 asks for and this closes:

    1 map cell = 1 model unit = 64 atlas pixels.

So a face 0.5 units wide spans exactly 32 atlas pixels, and a model's texels
land at the same scale as the wall it stands against. Every face here is
UV-mapped by that rule rather than by an arbitrary unwrap.

CONVENTIONS (SPEC 1.8): OBJ (0,0,0) is the CENTRE of the owning map cell at
floor level; +Z is up; X/Y is the floor plane; one unit is one cell.

UV ORIENTATION: emitted in IMAGE space -- (0,0) is the TOP-LEFT of the atlas --
because presentation/obj_model.lua passes UVs straight through to LOVE, which
samples textures from the top-left. This is NOT the OBJ bottom-left convention;
mixing them up renders every piece vertically mirrored.

Usage:
