# Effekseer spike (30.07.2026)

## What it answered

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Does Effekseer expose a C API LuaJIT FFI can bind? | **No** — zero `extern "C"` in the runtime. A shim is required (§6.5.1) |
| Can the runtime be built without MSVC? | **Yes** — MinGW-w64, keeping the dependency to a ~250MB MSYS2 install (§6.5.1a) |
| Does the shim load and initialise against LOVE's own GL context? | **Yes** |
| Does an effect actually render inside a LOVE frame? | **Yes** — see `spike/spike-result.png` |
| Does Effekseer corrupt LOVE's cached GL state? | **No, once guarded** (§6.5.2) |

That last one was the risk most likely to sink this, so it was tested hardest:
`spike/main.lua` draws LOVE content before *and* after the effect, and exercises
a **custom shader, a scissor, an additive blend mode and a render-to-canvas**
across the effect draw — the states LOVE actually caches. All render correctly.

## Files

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `efk_shim.cpp` | The `extern "C"` wrapper. Plain ints/floats only; every `RefPtr`/vtable stays sealed C++-side. Separate entry points own screen-overlay and world-camera draws |
| `spike/main.lua` | LOVE harness: FFI-loads the DLL, plays an effect, auto-captures and exits |
| `spike/conf.lua` | 800x600 window for the harness |
| `spike/canvas-main.lua` | The one that matters for step 2: effect into a 256x240 canvas with a screen-space ortho camera |
| `spike/spike-result.png` | Proof frame: effect + LOVE state intact |
| `spike/spike-zorder-bug.png` | The batch-flush bug, for comparison |
| `spike/spike-canvas-256x240.png` | Effect rendering inside the game's real canvas |

## Authoring scale (read before making effects)

`efk_load_effect(path, magnification)` exists because effects are authored in
world units, and under a 1-unit-per-pixel camera a 3D-scale effect renders about
20px across.

**Magnification is a workaround, not the fix.** Scaling up yields soft, linearly
filtered gradients that fight hand-authored pixel art. Author effects **at game
scale** — particles sized in the tens of pixels, small crisp textures, hard
edges over soft gradients. Cheap now, expensive to retrofit across a finished
library. See roadmap §6.5.1d.

## Building the DLL

The built DLL is **not** committed (6.1MB build artifact, gitignored). That
policy only holds if rebuilding is one command, so it is one:

```bash
.\tools\effekseer\build.ps1
```

`build.ps1` is the executable form of roadmap §6.5.1a — it clones and
configures Effekseer if needed (every load-bearing CMake flag, and the reasons,
are comments in the script), builds the two static libraries, links the shim,
and writes `effekseer_shim.dll` to the repo root. `-EffekseerRoot` and
`-MinGWBin` override the defaults. Requires MinGW-w64 via MSYS2, **not MSVC**.

`-static` matters: without it the DLL pulls in `libwinpthread-1.dll` and stops
being a single self-contained file. As built it depends only on `KERNEL32`,
`msvcrt` and `OPENGL32`.

Verified 01.08.2026: a from-source rebuild renders G5's 129 reference frames
byte-identically, including the effect fixture frame — so the script reproduces
*the* shim, not merely *a* shim.

### A stale DLL used to be worse than a missing one

An absent DLL has always degraded gracefully (owner decision, §6.5.1e). An
**out of date** one did not: `ffi.load` succeeded, `efk_init` succeeded, and the
process died much later at the first call to a symbol that build never exported
— deep inside a draw, with an FFI message naming a symbol and nothing else.
This bit a worktree running a shim from before `efk_set_effect_flip` existed.

`presentation/effekseer.lua` now resolves **every** symbol its `CDEF` declares
at init and degrades on the first missing one, naming the symbol and the fix.
`build.ps1` cross-checks the same two lists after linking. The list is parsed
from the declarations at both ends rather than written a third time, so a new
export is covered the moment it is added.

The consequence worth stating: **rebuild after pulling** if the shim gained
exports. There is no committed fallback binary to fall back to — there was one
briefly, `effekseer_shim.dll.bak-preseed`, committed by accident inside an
assets commit and deleted 01.08.2026. It was a pre-flip, pre-RNG-seed build
sitting in the repo under a name that read like a safety net.

## The z-order trap (found via prior art, 30.07.2026)

**LOVE batches draw calls. You must flush its batch before drawing effects, or
they render behind everything LOVE queued that frame.**

```lua
love.graphics.flushBatch()   -- present in LOVE 11.5; call before efk_draw
efk.efk_draw(view, proj)
```

Credit where due: this came from
[`gittup/EffekseerForLove`](https://github.com/gittup/EffekseerForLove), which
documents it in `src/wrap/EffectManager.cpp`. That project has no
`flushBatch` available in its target and pokes `love.graphics.setColorMask`
instead, which forces a flush as a side effect. On 11.5 the direct call
exists, so use it.

`spike/spike-zorder-bug.png` is the failure and `spike/spike-result.png` the
fix, from the same harness with `FLUSH` toggled.

**Note on how nearly this was missed.** The first probe appeared to pass — but
it drew a text label between the quad and the effect, and switching to the font
texture makes LOVE flush anyway, hiding the bug. Any state change that forces a
batch flush will mask this. When testing draw ordering, the shape under test
must be the **last** LOVE call before `efk_draw`.

## The GL state guard

`GLStateGuard` in `efk_shim.cpp` saves and restores the program, VAO, array and
element buffer bindings, active texture unit, 2D texture binding, blend /
depth-test / cull-face enables, and the depth write mask around every
`efk_draw`. `glGetIntegerv` is GL 1.1 and links directly; the setters are GL
2.0+ and are resolved at runtime via `wglGetProcAddress` with a
`GetProcAddress` fallback.

**This is the load-bearing part of the integration.** If LOVE ever renders
incorrectly *after* an effect, look here first, and extend the saved set rather
than working around it at the call site.

## What is deliberately not here

- Effekseer's sound backends — all four are switched off at configure time.
  LOVE owns audio.
- Engine wiring. That now lives in `presentation/effekseer.lua` and the
  `effekseer` animation track type, not in this spike directory — see the
  callout at the top of this file.
- Determinism plumbing. `efk_update` already takes an explicit delta in
  Effekseer frame units rather than reading a clock, which is what §3.1
  requires, but nothing drives it from the harness clock yet.

## Determinism: the shim owns the RNG (01.08.2026)

**Rebuild the DLL if yours predates this** — `efk_set_random_seed` is a new
export, and without it effect playback is not reproducible.

Effekseer seeds every played instance from `Manager`'s rand func, which
defaults to `ManagerImplemented::Rand` -> plain `rand()`. That reads the C
runtime's **process-global** RNG state, which nothing in this project pins:
`math.randomseed` seeds LuaJIT's own PRNG, not `srand`. So the same effect
played from the same fixed clock rendered differently in every process, and
G5's fixture frame could never be byte-reproduced.

The shim now installs its own xorshift32 via `SetRandFunc` at `efk_init`, and
exposes `efk_set_random_seed(seed)`; the screenshot harness reseeds per scene
alongside `math.randomseed`. Verified: two consecutive full runs are 123/123
identical **including** the frame with a live effect, and changing the seed to
999 changes that frame and only that frame.

## World-camera pass (01.08.2026)

`efk_draw_world(view, projection, zNear, zFar)` is distinct from the late
screen-space overlay. It preserves LOVE's populated world depth attachment and
draws directly into the full 256x240 world canvas. Lua bridges the game's X/Y
floor, Z-up convention to Effekseer's conventional X/Z floor, Y-up axes. The
`env_mist` is gated visibly at its authored frame-400 opacity milestone while
the populated world depth attachment is preserved.

### `env_rain` was never broken (corrected 01.08.2026)

This file previously recorded that `env_rain` "produces no pixels through the
perspective pass" and called it a renderer compatibility follow-up. **It is
not.** Rain renders correctly through the world camera. Two faults in how it was
being *observed* stacked up to make it look otherwise, and both are traps for
the next person:

1. **The observation had no receding depth.** The fixture used a 3x3 grid with
   the camera facing a wall one cell away, so the depth buffer rejected every
   particle. Measured: 111 live instances, 0 pixels. The effect was emitting
   perfectly the whole time. Down a 20-cell corridor the same effect at the same
   frame paints visible streaks.
2. **A single large `deltaFrame` skips the simulation rather than
   fast-forwarding it.** Emitters fire per simulated frame, so one 400-frame
   update yielded 1,338 mist instances where 400 one-frame updates yield 1,904 —
   and, worse, left the manager unable to emit anything but the root for the
   *next* effect played, which is what made the second effect in any A/B look
   dead. `effekseer.update` now sub-steps.

A finite effect sampled past its end is a third way to read zero, so a milestone
frame belongs to an effect, not to the suite.

**The pattern, for the fourth time in this integration** (after the self-flushing
z-order probe, the settle that killed short effects, and the settle that
corrupted unrelated scenes): the measurement was wrong, not the thing measured,
and it failed in the direction that looks like a real defect. A world-effect
observation that reports zero should be assumed unable to see before it is
assumed to have found something.
