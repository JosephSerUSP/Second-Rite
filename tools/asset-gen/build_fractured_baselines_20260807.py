"""Fracture as a base-surface variant, not as a fixture.

The 08-07 review settled this. A thin recessed feature cannot win as a fixture:
merged over a finished surface it competes with that surface for the depth
field's dynamic range, and a scratch never beats a coffer. At depth weight 0.76
the model read the seam as a raised ribbon lying on the ceiling; at 0.40 it
followed the dominant signal and the fissure simply vanished. There is no weight
in between that turns it into a cut, because the ambiguity is not about strength.

A crack is a property of the material, so it belongs in the material: these are
whole opaque surfaces generated WITH the fracture already in them, which is also
the shape every 5-and-6 rated map in this project has had.

The one real constraint a fixture did not have: a base surface is instanced in
every cell, so the fracture network has to TILE. Every crack here is a level set
of a periodic field, so it wraps by construction rather than by correction.

    Stone does not crack in sinuous curves -- it cracks in straight runs that

    Voronoi edges are that shape by construction: straight segments, Y junctions
    where three cells meet, and toroidal by the same seed geometry the slab maps

    becoming a complete mosaic, because a fractured surface is cracked in places,
    not tessellated everywhere.

    `cells` is how many fragments the surface is broken into, and is deliberately
    independent of any slab layout in the base surface:
    a crack that followed the mortar would only deepen the joints it ran along.
