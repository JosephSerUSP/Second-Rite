# Second Rite Blender Modeling

This skill adapts the Apache-2.0 `blender-3d-modeling` terminal skill from
`Andrew1326/dominations/.claude/skills/blender-3d-modeling` to the Second Rite
asset contract and shared Blender core. Attribution details are in `NOTICE.md`.

## Route by intent first

Pick the lane before writing any code. Each lane has one entry point and one
gate. Do not build a parallel exporter or a second recipe vocabulary.

| I want to… | Lane / entry point | Gate before done |
|---|---|---|
| author or fix an **item model** | per-item source `projects/hichaukitoden-game/assets/authoring/items/<id>.blend`, compiled read-only by `python tools/blender/compile_item_blends.py [--source …]`; read that folder's `README.md` | `compile_item_blends.py --check`, then `python tools/asset-production/check_item_models.py` |
| build a **town interior** (St. Maria) | a recipe under `tools/blender/recipes/` using `interior.py` (`Interior`) + `furnishings.py`; copy the shape of `alicias_padaria.py`; brief `docs/design/st-maria-interior-authoring.md` | register the `.blend` in `environment-sources.json`; `python tools/blender/environment_sources.py --check` |
| build a **town exterior** | `recipes/exterior.py`; buildings via `recipes/house_grammar/` (validated data); brief `docs/design/st-maria-exterior-authoring.md` | same as interiors |
| add a **reusable prop for rooms** | a new function in `recipes/furnishings.py` (check the existing 49 first) | used by a recipe; no `room.part` copies of an existing furnishing |
| bake/export an **environment package** | `export_room_environment.py` / `export_exterior_environment.py` (see `BLENDER_CORE.md` §EEVEE) | owner review; G5 for anything shipped |
| bind or texture a **material** | a semantic id from `tools/asset-language/materials.json` (read the file, the id list grows); textures via `tools/blender/material_library.py` | `python tools/asset-language/check.py all` |
| make a **surface relief** baseline | not this skill: use `second-rite-surface-baselines` | — |

Never regenerate an **adopted** `.blend` (see `environment-sources.json` and
`BLENDER_CORE.md`). Scripts named `study_*` or the `*registry*` revision
scripts are history, not templates. Paths are Project-relative: the repository
root has no `assets/` or `data/` since #700.

## Read first

```text
docs/asset-pipeline/BLENDER_CORE.md
docs/asset-pipeline/SURFACE_BASELINES_V2.md
tools/asset-language/contract.json
tools/asset-language/materials.json
tools/blender/second_rite_asset_core.py
```

## Choose the correct authority

### Props, items, fixtures and openings

Blender geometry may be canonical:

```text
procedural recipe → Blender mesh → OBJ/MTL → runtime or item display
```

### Wall, floor and ceiling relief baselines

Blender is derivative only:

```text
fixed-point scalar field → canonical PNGs → Blender inspection mesh
```

Do not ray-cast a Blender surface back into a V2 canonical height map.

## Coordinate and scale rules

- Blender authoring is Z-up.
- World props use `world_cell`; one cell is 2.5 metres of design scale.
- Item displays use dimensionless `item_display` coordinates and viewport fit.
- Surface previews use the `depth_tile` XY domain and relief along +Z.
- OBJ export is `-Z` forward and `Y` up.
- Engine conversion remains `(x, y, z) → (x, -z, y)`.
- Put world roots at the contract placement frame, not an arbitrary visual centre.

## Prefer data APIs over repeated operators

For simple static meshes:

```python
mesh = bpy.data.meshes.new("Name")
mesh.from_pydata(vertices, edges, faces)
mesh.update()
obj = bpy.data.objects.new("Name", mesh)
bpy.context.collection.objects.link(obj)
```

For topology operations use `bmesh` and always release it:

```python
bm = bmesh.new()
# create or transform geometry
bm.to_mesh(mesh)
bm.free()
mesh.update()
```

Use `bpy.ops` only where direct data APIs are impractical. Before an operator,
set selection, active object and mode explicitly.

## Shared core

Do not reimplement scene, material, metadata, hierarchy, bounds or OBJ-export
infrastructure. Import:

```python
import second_rite_asset_core as asset_core
```

Use shared functions such as:

```text
reset_scene
ensure_collection
parent_local
make_material
assign_material
flat_shade
add_bevel_modifier
tag_asset_target
validate_asset_metadata
export_asset_root
```

## Deterministic modeling

- Use fixed seeds and repository-owned integer hashes.
- Keep recipe parameters explicit and serializable.
- Sort objects and generated elements before export.
- Avoid unseeded `random`, particle systems, simulation, remeshing and adaptive
  geometry when they determine production output.
- Apply modifiers only when the resulting topology is required and tested.
- Prefer low segment counts, deliberate faceting and readable silhouettes.
- Treat PSX-era inadequacy as art direction, not as malformed geometry.

## Second Rite modeling vocabulary

Build forms from understandable families:

- primitives and CSG for doors, chests, altars, machinery and frames;
- profile extrusion for arches, ironwork, mouldings and relief silhouettes;
- curves for cables, roots, handles and trim;
- radial construction for vessels, seals and ritual mechanisms;
- fixed scalar fields for rocks, masonry and terrain-like relief;
- alpha slices only when a volume is intentionally sprite-like.

Do not start with high-poly sculpting when a controlled low-poly recipe can
express the same object.

## Materials

Bind defensible semantic IDs from `tools/asset-language/materials.json`. Read
the file for the current list rather than relying on a copy (it holds stone,
metal, wood, cloth, glass and St. Maria ids such as `whitewash`, `azulejo`,
`terracotta`, `roof_tile`).

Preserve explicit legacy numeric values when equivalence is required. Do not
invent a semantic binding merely to eliminate an unbound-material report.

## Metadata

Every production or inspection root must call `tag_asset_target` with valid:

```text
asset_id
representation
role
authoring_space
placement_frame
states
variants
```

Use `preview_only` only for assets that must never be promoted. Surface preview
meshes remain `surface_material` but must record `sr_preview_only=true` and the
canonical field hash.

## Export and validation

- Duplicate authored hierarchies before origin-centering export.
- Never move the authored root as a side effect.
- Restore selection and active object in `finally`.
- Export only intended geometry.
- Validate OBJ counts, bounds, `usemtl`, `mtllib`, and parsed MTL semantics.
- Write builds and previews to temporary output unless production promotion is
  explicitly requested.

Run Blender scripts headlessly:

```text
blender --background --factory-startup --python <script.py> -- <arguments>
```

Print one machine-readable JSON result line for automation.
