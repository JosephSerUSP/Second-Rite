-- How a test suite reports failure.
--
-- Every suite used to end with `error("... tests failed")`, which drops LÖVE
-- into its interactive error screen -- a window that sits there until a HUMAN
-- notices and closes it. Under the CLI runner (and for any agent or CI job
-- driving `lovec . unittest`) that turned a red test into a hang: the failure
-- detail was already printed, but the process refused to end.
--
-- Worse, it stopped the run dead at the FIRST red suite, leaving everything
-- after it unmeasured. That is how a broken early-balance assertion sat
-- unnoticed behind a failing status-infliction suite -- nobody had seen the
-- later suites run at all.
--
-- So a suite records its failure here and returns; main.lua runs the whole
-- list, prints one summary and exits non-zero at the end. No keypress, no
-- hidden suites, and the exit code is still the gate's answer.
