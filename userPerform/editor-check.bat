REM  G3 - EDITOR GATE
REM  Starts the editor server on http://127.0.0.1:8080 and

REM  PASS when: the editor loads, you exercise the changed UI,
REM             the browser console shows ZERO errors, and a
REM             Save round-trips cleanly.
REM  Close this window (Ctrl+C) to stop the server when done.
