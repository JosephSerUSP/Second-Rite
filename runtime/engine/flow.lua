-- Phase flows per SPEC S4 (docs/archive/plans/overhaul-3): data/flows.json maps
-- scene phases ("battle.victory", "exploration.step", ...) to command lists
-- executed in immediate mode by engine/interpreter.lua.
--
-- ctx shape (passed straight to interpreter.runImmediate):
--   session (required), loader, battle, party, enemies,
--   a/b/target/enemy/ally battler refs, v (flow-locals).
--
-- EVERY host calls flow.run(phase, ctx) unconditionally. flows.json is the
-- only source of phase logic, and the validator requires each phase a host
-- depends on to exist, so there is nothing to fall back to and no reason to
-- ask first.
--
-- The battle hosts used to guard their calls with `if flow.has(phase) then ...
-- else <legacy Lua> end`, keeping a second implementation alive behind each
-- one. All three were deleted on 26.07.2026 (round_end, flee_attempt,
-- battle_start); the round-end pair had already drifted apart. `flow.has` now
-- has exactly one caller, the validator's required-phase check, which is the
-- job it should have had all along: proving a phase exists, not choosing
-- whether to use it.
--
-- A future host (e.g. a menu scene) declares phases by simply adding a new
-- top-level object to flows.json ("menu": { "open": [...] }) and calling
-- flow.run("menu.open", ctx) at the right moment; no registration step.
