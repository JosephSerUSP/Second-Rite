-- Level-up reporting: what changed about a creature between two points in time.
--
-- The engine has never had a way to SAY that a creature grew. Battler:gainExp
-- applies growth silently and returns a boolean, so the only visible trace of a
-- level-up was the victory panel's gauge rolling over. This module turns "the
-- party before" and "the party now" into structured rows a window can draw.
--
-- It lives here, not in the battle scene, for two reasons. It is not
-- battle-specific -- any host that can grant EXP (a quest reward, a ritual, a
-- future training site) can snapshot around its own grant and get the same
-- report. And the battle scene's job is to PUBLISH this onto its scene vars, so
-- the window itself stays entirely data-authored (data/scenes.json +
-- engine.json windowLayout) rather than a bespoke Lua drawer.
--
-- Snapshots are keyed by PARTY SLOT, never by battler identity: a level-up can
-- fire an automatic transform (engine/transform.lua), which replaces the object
-- sitting in session.party[i] with a new one. Identity-keyed lookup would lose
-- exactly the creature whose report matters most.
